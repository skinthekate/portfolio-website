    <h1>Katelynn's Portfolio</h1>
    <div class="mainText">
    <p>This website serves as Katelynn's portfolio. It includes both an audio narratice about desire and horror and a video essay
        about contentment and Fantastic Mr. Fox.</p>
    <p>While I would describe myself as an artist, I would never even dream of saying I'm skilled at any type of graphic design.
        This often reads as contradictory to people unfamiliar with these skills. If they're both such visual and creative skills,
        why don't they translate? There is some overlap, but many of the most essential aspects of graphic design involve
        knowledge entirely outside the scope of "art." Accessibility and function are fundamental to good graphic design, and art
        is uninterested in those aspects. For these reasons, I was immensely worried for how this website would go.</p>
    <p>Years ago, I had to make a portfolio website for the class I was taking at the time. While the website itself is now long
        gone, I vividly remember its many failings. It was incredibly hard on the eyes, with soft pink text on a bright yellow 
        background. Colors that are cute and give you an aching headache after a few seconds of trying to read. I wanted to
        ensure I wouldn't make the same mistakes this time around. To do so, I decided on a light pink and used 
        <a href="https://coolors.co/edced6-e63946-f8f4a6-265876-2a2e45">Coolors</a> to create a balanced color palette around it.
        Then I focused on making sure all my text was readable using a color contrast checker.</p>
    <p>While integral to design, colors aren't the only factor in making a website appealing and accessible. For my headers, 
        I used "Georgia" to stand out and used "Arial" for smaller text like paragraphs and credits, as it is meant for that and 
        uniquely helpful for dyslexic users. I decided to add a navigation bar, both to make the website easier to navigate and to 
        add an extra splash of polish. I also changed around some formatting, most notably switching my photos to the Projects 
        page to better seperate each segment there.</p>
    <p>Creating this portfolio website was certainly something I had no idea how to tackle, but looking deeper in how design 
        works and using my previous website as a cautionary tale helped immensely. It also served as a last hurrah to the other 
        projects I had made in this class by finding photos to represent both my audio narrative and video essay.
